## Getting Started

(clone the repo first)

### 1. Install dependencies

It is encouraged to use **yarn** so the husky hooks can work properly.

```bash
yarn install
```

### 2. Run the development server

You can start the server using this command:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://127.0.0.1:5173/](http://127.0.0.1:5173/) with your browser to see the result.
